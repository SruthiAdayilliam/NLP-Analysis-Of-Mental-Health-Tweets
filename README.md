**NLP Analysis of Mental Health Tweets**
**Overview**
This project performs sentiment analysis on mental healthâ€“related tweets, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral.
It uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction.
Multiple machine learning models were trained, with Bernoulli Naive Bayes achieving the highest accuracy.

**Features**
Classifies tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories.

Implements preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

Uses TF-IDF vectorization for numerical feature representation.

Compares multiple machine learning models for accuracy.

**Technologies Used**

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

NLTK

Jupyter Notebook

**Results**

Bernoulli Naive Bayes achieved the highest accuracy (87%) for sentiment classification.
